## Abstract
Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. This study develops a predictive model for survival outcomes in breast cancer patients using logistic regression, leveraging demographic, clinical, and pathological factors from a prospective cohort dataset. The analysis focuses on identifying key predictors of mortality, evaluating model performance across racial groups, and addressing fairness in prediction accuracy. Tumor stage, grade, and hormone receptor status emerged as significant predictors. The initial logistic regression model achieved a moderate performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.74. However, disparities in model performance were observed between racial groups, prompting the implementation of reweighting strategies to enhance fairness. These findings highlight the importance of equitable modeling approaches to improve prognostic accuracy and clinical outcomes in breast cancer care. 

## Introduction
Breast cancer is highly prevalence with 2.3 million new cases worldwide reported in 2022$^1$. Approximately 13.1 % of female are diagnosed with breast cancer at some point in their lifetime. This type of cancer accounts for 23% of total cancer cases and 14% of cancer deaths$^2$. Advances diagnosis and tailored treatments have reduced mortality rates$3$. Survival of breast cancer depends on various factors including the tumor size, the grade of tumor$^4$, cancer stage, lymph node stages, and socioeconomic and race$^5$. Younger patients often have better outcomes$^6$ while disparities exist for lower-income and African American populations. This report examines data from a prospective cohort of breast cancer patients, which includes variables including demographic, clinical, and pathological factors, aiming to improve outcomes and address disparities.

## Methods

**Data Description** The dataset includes 10 categorical variables: race
(Black, White, Other), marital status (Divorced, Married, Separated,
Single, Widowed), tumor stage (T1, T2, T3, T4), lymph node stage (N1,
N2, N3), adjusted AJCC 6th stage (IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, IIIC), tumor
differentiation (Well, Moderately, Poorly, Undifferentiated), grade
(1–4), tumor spread stage (Regional, Distant), estrogen receptor status
(Positive, Negative), and progesterone receptor status (Positive,
Negative). Additionally, there are 4 continuous variables: age, tumor
size, regional nodes examined, and regional nodes positive.

**Data Cleaning** Column headers were renamed, categorical variables
were converted to factors. tumor grade levels were recoded to ensure
interpretability. Missing values were assessed, and log transformations
were applied to highly skewed continuous variables (tumor size, regional
nodes examined, and regional nodes positive) to normalize their
distributions.

```{r data import and initial tidy, include = FALSE}
# Import data and clean column names
data <- read.csv("./data/Project_2_data.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()

# Select relevant covariates (variables 1-14) and outcome variable
model_data <- data %>%
  dplyr::select(-survival_months)

# Convert categorical variables to factors and relabel `grade`
model_data <- model_data %>%
  mutate(
    race = factor(race),
    marital_status = factor(marital_status),
    t_stage = factor(t_stage),
    n_stage = factor(n_stage),
    x6th_stage = factor(x6th_stage),
    differentiate = factor(differentiate),
    a_stage = factor(a_stage),
    estrogen_status = factor(estrogen_status),
    progesterone_status = factor(progesterone_status),
    status = factor(status, levels = c("Alive", "Dead")),
    grade = case_when(
      grade == "1" ~ "1",
      grade == "2" ~ "2",
      grade == "3" ~ "3",
      grade == " anaplastic; Grade IV" ~ "4",
      TRUE ~ NA_character_
    ) %>% factor(levels = c("1", "2", "3", "4"))
  )

# Summarize structure of the cleaned dataset
summary(model_data)
```

**EDA Methods** `skim()` function is applied to the dataset
(`model_data`) to compute detailed summary statistics for all variables.
(table.1 & 2), Group-wise key statistics are calculated based on
survival status(table.3) Cramér's V was used to quantify the strength of
the association between categorical variables and the binary outcome
(Alive/Dead), with values ranging from 0 (no association) to 1 (perfect
association). Distributional plots, including proportional bar plots for
race groups and histograms for continuous variables, were created to
visualize the data. Boxplots stratified by survival status were used to
explore relationships between continuous variables and the binary
outcome. A correlation matrix for continuous variables was generated to
assess pairwise relationship between variables.

**Modeling Assumptions and Transformations** Logistic regression was
chosen as the primary method due to the binary nature of the outcome.
Assumptions checked are: 1. The response variable (status) was confirmed
to be binary by code.

```{r binary response, include = FALSE}
# Binary or Dichotomous Response Variable
unique(model_data$status)
#The response variable (status) has exactly two categories: Alive and Dead.

```

2\. The `alias()` function identified collinearity between models:
grade2, grade3, and grade4 with other predictors, x6th_stageIIIC with
n_stage, and differentiate with grade. For simplification, some
variables were removed: x6th_stage captures n_stage's information,
n_stage was dropped. t_stage (linked to tumor size), differentiate
(overlapping with grade), and regional_node_positive (redundant with
tumor size and regional_node_examined) were removed.

```{r multicollinearity1, echo = FALSE}
# Fit an initial logistic regression model
model_data_1 <- model_data %>%
  mutate(
    race = relevel(race, ref = "White"),  # Set "White" as reference
    grade = relevel(grade, ref = "1"),    # Set "Grade 1" as reference
    x6th_stage = relevel(x6th_stage, ref = "IIA") # Set "IIA" as reference
  )

alias_results <- capture.output(alias(glm(status ~ ., data = model_data_1, family = binomial)))

writeLines(alias_results, "results/alias_results_model1.txt")
```

VIF were calculated, to ensure that all values were below 5 (table.4),
indicating no multicollinearity. (dataset updated with dropped variable)

```{r multicollinearity2, echo = FALSE}
model_data_2 <- model_data_1 %>%
  dplyr::select(-differentiate, -n_stage, -t_stage, -reginol_node_positive)

# Multicollinearity check with alias()
alias_results_2 <- capture.output(alias(glm(status ~ ., data = model_data_2, family = binomial)))
writeLines(alias_results_2, "results/alias_results_model2.txt")

# Fit a logistic regression model
model_vif <- glm(status ~ ., data = model_data_2, family = binomial)

# Calculate VIF
vif_values <- vif(model_vif)
vif_df <- as.data.frame(vif_values)
vif_df <- tibble::rownames_to_column(vif_df, var = "Variable")
colnames(vif_df) <- c("Variable", "GVIF", "Df", "GVIF_Ratio")
write.csv(vif_df, "tables/vif.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

3\. Continuous predictors were log-transformed, and their relationships
with the log odds were examined (fig.12). This confirmed linearity.
(dataset updated with transformed variable)

```{r Log Odds, include = FALSE, message = FALSE}
continuous_vars_log_odds <- model_data_2 %>%
  dplyr::select(age, tumor_size, regional_node_examined, status) %>%  # Include 'status'
  na.omit()

# Log-transform tumor size and regional nodes examined
df_log_odds <- continuous_vars_log_odds %>%
  mutate(
    age_log = log(age + 1),
    tumor_size_log = log(tumor_size + 1),
    rn_examined_log = log(regional_node_examined + 1)
  )

linearity_test <- glm(status ~ age_log + tumor_size_log + rn_examined_log, 
                      data = df_log_odds, 
                      family = binomial)

df_log_odds$logit <- predict(linearity_test, type = "link") 


plot1 <- ggplot(df_log_odds, aes(x = age_log, y = logit)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +

       x = "Log(Age + 1)", y = "Logit (Log Odds)") +

  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "purple") +
  labs(title = "Logit vs Regional Nodes Examined (Log-Transformed)", 
       x = "Log(Regional Nodes Examined + 1)", y = "Logit (Log Odds)") +
  theme_minimal()

log_odds_grid <- grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, plot3, ncol = 3)
ggsave("plots/logit_grid_plot.png", plot = log_odds_grid, width = 18, height = 6)

# Update
model_data_3 <- model_data_2 %>%
  mutate(
    tumor_size_log = log(tumor_size + 1),
    rn_examined_log = log(regional_node_examined + 1),
    age_log = log(age + 1)
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(-tumor_size, -regional_node_examined, -age) 
```

4\. Independence of Errors: Since there were no group-level structures,
the independence assumption was satisfied.

```{r outliers1, include = FALSE}
# Fit logistic regression model with log-transformed predictors
full_model <- glm(status ~ ., 
                 data = model_data_3, family = binomial)

# Cook's Distance
cooksD <- cooks.distance(model_vif)

# Plot
png("plots/cooks_distance_plot.png", width = 800, height = 600)
plot(cooksD, pch = 20)
abline(h = 4 / nrow(model_data_3), col = "red")
dev.off()

# Identify
influential_obs <- which(cooksD > 4 / nrow(model_data_3))

# Build Model
model_no_outliers <- glm(status ~ ., 
                         data = model_data_3[-influential_obs, ], family = binomial)

model_robust <- glmrob(status ~ .,
                       data = model_data_3, family = binomial, method = "Mqle")

# Extract summaries
full_coefficients <- summary(full_model)$coefficients
no_outliers_coefficients <- summary(model_no_outliers)$coefficients
robust_coefficients <- summary(model_robust)$coefficients

# Identify unstable coefficients
unstable_coeffs <- which(
  (abs(full_coefficients[, "Estimate"] - no_outliers_coefficients[, "Estimate"]) > 2) |
  (abs(full_coefficients[, "Std. Error"] - no_outliers_coefficients[, "Std. Error"]) > 2)
)
unstable_coeffs_df <- data.frame(
  Variable = rownames(full_coefficients)[unstable_coeffs],
  Full_Coef = full_coefficients[unstable_coeffs, "Estimate"],
  Full_SE = full_coefficients[unstable_coeffs, "Std. Error"],
  No_Outliers_Coef = no_outliers_coefficients[unstable_coeffs, "Estimate"],
  No_Outliers_SE = no_outliers_coefficients[unstable_coeffs, "Std. Error"],
  Robust_Coef = robust_coefficients[rownames(full_coefficients)[unstable_coeffs], "Estimate"],
  Robust_SE = robust_coefficients[rownames(full_coefficients)[unstable_coeffs], "Std. Error"]
)

write.csv(unstable_coeffs_df, "tables/unstable_coefficients.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

```{r outliers2, echo = FALSE, results='hide'}
# Extract robustness weights
robust_summary <- capture.output(summary(model_robust))
start_line <- grep("Robustness weights w.r \\* w.x:", robust_summary)
end_line <- start_line + 5
desired_section <- robust_summary[start_line:end_line]
cat(paste(desired_section, collapse = "\n"))
```

5\. Outliers: Cook's Distance identified potential outliers exceeding
4/n, which flagged numerous points as influential, likely reflecting
population variability rather than errors (fig.13). Models with and
without these points were compared. Removing these points destabilized
coefficients like grade, making them unreliable. Robust logistic
regression (model_robust) mitigated outliers impact, providing stable
estimates for predictors (table.5). About 12% of data had reduced
influence, while most observations are unaffected. Despite its
advantages, we chose the original logistic regression for simplicity and
familiarity.

**Model Construction and Selection** Models were constructed using
predictors identified during EDA and assumption checks. Forward,
backward, and stepwise selection were applied based on the AIC to select
the final model. Interaction effects were tested by examining pairwise interactions between predictors. 

**Model Validation and Fairness** The model was validated using 10-fold
cross-validation, evaluating ROC-AUC, sensitivity, and specificity.
Fairness was assessed by evaluating model performance across racial
subgroups (White, Black, Other) based on subgroup-specific ROC-AUC
values. To address disparities, inverse probability weighting (IPW) was applied: the proportions were computed as the size of each group divided by the total sample size (White: 3413, Other: 320, Black: 291) (table.1). The weights `W` were then derived as follows: $W = \frac{1}{\text{Proportion}}$.The calculated weights were 1.18 for White, 13.89 for Black, and 12.50 for Other. To keep weights manageable, we normalized them such that the maximum weight was scaled to 2, resulting in final weights of 0.17 for White, 2.00 for Black, and 1.80 for Other. The reweighted model's performance was then compared to the original, using subgroup-specific and overall AUC values to assess predictive fairness. Predictor coefficients were interpreted as odds ratios to quantify their impact on survival outcomes.


## Results
**EDA** Cramér’s V analysis identified `x6th_stage`, `n_stage`, and
hormone receptor statuses as the strongest predictors of survival, while
`marital status`, `race`, and `a_stage` showed weaker associations
(fig.1). Bar plots highlight racial disparities, with higher mortality
among Non-White, particularly Black patients, and combining groups
simplifies comparisons (figs.2–3). Histograms revealed significant right
skewness for most continuous variables (except `age`), improved by log
transformations for the other continuous vars (figs.4–5). Boxplots
confirm these patterns (figs.6–10). A correlation matrix showed weak
overall relationships and no multicollinearity, except
`regional_node_positive` is moderately associated with both `tumor size`
(0.24) and `regional nodes examined` (0.41), guiding modeling choices
(fig.11).

**Model Selection and Intepretation**

```{r variable selection original, echo = FALSE}
# Forward selection
forward_model <- step(glm(status ~ ., data = model_data_3, family = binomial), scope = list(lower = ~1, upper = full_model), direction = "forward", trace = 0)

# Backward elimination
backward_model <- step(glm(status ~ ., data = model_data_3, family = binomial), direction = "backward", trace = 0)

# Stepwise selection
stepwise_model <- step(glm(status ~ ., data = model_data_3, family = binomial), scope = list(lower = ~1, upper = full_model), direction = "both", trace = 0)

writeLines(capture.output(summary(full_model)), "results/full_model_summary.txt")
writeLines(capture.output(summary(forward_model)), "results/forward_model_summary.txt")
writeLines(capture.output(summary(backward_model)), "results/backward_model_summary.txt")
writeLines(capture.output(summary(stepwise_model)), "results/stepwise_model_summary.txt")
```
AIC values differed slightly (Full: 3039.8; Forward: 3039.8; Backward: 3037.5; Stepwise: 3037.5), but all methods yielded the same model. The stepwise model was chosen for its lower AIC (full results attached):
$$Logit(P) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times raceBlack + \beta_2 \times raceOther + \ldots + \beta_i \times X_i $$
Where $\beta_i$ values are taken from Table 10, $X_i$ represents other significant predictors, and $Logit(P) = log(\frac{P}{1-P})$, P is the probability of the `status` being 1.

**Key Findings on Coefficients of Final Model-Original** Table 6 highlights the coefficients for key predictors. Race was significant, with `raceBlack` (0.47961) associated with higher odds of death and `raceOther` (-0.42884) linked to lower odds compared to White patients. `x6th_stage` was the strongest predictor, with higher stages (e.g., IIIC) significantly increasing mortality risk. Poorly differentiated tumors (`Grades 3`: 0.91053, `Grade 4`: 1.87333) also raised mortality odds, while positive hormone receptor status reduced the likelihood of death. Log-transformed predictors showed `rn_examined_log` (-0.29822) improved survival odds, while `age_log` (1.09581) indicated higher mortality risk for older patients. Marital status had no strong associations.

**Model Performance**  Cross-validation (10-fold) revealed an overall ROC-AUC of 0.7400, indicating moderately good performance with an acceptable ability to
distinguish between "Alive" and "Dead" outcomes. The model demonstrated
high sensitivity (0.985), meaning it correctly identifies most of the "Dead" cases, but low specificity (0.122), indicating difficulty in correctly identifying "Alive" cases (full results attached).

The model performance varies across different racial groups.It demonstrates high ROC-AUC for the White group (0.7504), while the lower scores were evaluated for the Black group (0.7021) and Other group (0.6584).When Black and Other groups are combined as a single minority group, the model ROC-AUC improves to 0.7313, though it remains lower than the majority White group.
Reweighting narrowed this gap, increasing the model’s ROC-AUC for the minority group to 0.7358, closer to the White group (0.7486), improving fairness while maintaining accuracy (table.8). The model equation must be adjusted accordingly if the reweighted model is chosen: $$Logit(P) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times raceBlack + \ldots + \beta_i \times X_i$$ where $\beta_i$ values are from Table 7, and $X_i$ represents the same significant predictors as in the original stepwise model.

## Conclusion and Limitation
This study developed a logistic regression model to predict breast cancer survival, highlighting key predictors and addressing racial disparities. Tumor stage and grade were the strongest predictors, with higher stages (e.g., IIIA, IIIB, IIIC) and poorly differentiated tumors (Grades 3 and 4) significantly increasing mortality risk. Positive hormone receptor status improved survival odds, while older age and inadequate lymph node evaluation increased mortality risk. Racial disparities were evident: Black patients faced higher odds of death (OR = 1.5) compared to White patients, while the "Other" race group had lower odds (OR = 0.6). 

Reweighting improved fairness for underrepresented groups, increasing the minority group’s ROC-AUC from 0.7313 to 0.7358 and narrowing the gap with the White group (0.7486). However, it may reduce generalizability to majority-dominant populations and alter predictor importance, requiring careful interpretation. Stepwise selection treated factor levels as independent variables (e.g., `x6th_stageIIIA` as a dummy), potentially excluding some levels and raising interpretability concerns. Marital status was retained in the final model despite weak significance due to its potential theoretical relevance, confounding effects, or fairness considerations. All three aspects—reweighting, factor level treatment, and marital status inclusion—require further research to ensure robustness and interpretability.
